      At the heart of aikido is the concept of ‚Äòki‚Äô or one‚Äôs ‚Äòlife-force‚Äô.
      Aikido training seeks to fuse universal ki which flows within each
      individual. Aikido translates as ‚Äúthe Way of harmonious spirit‚Äù, and like
      other budo arts seeks for the unification of technique, body, and mind.
      The way one holds his or her heart in aikido lies at the root of ai-ki
      (harmony with ki), which is, according to Ueshiba Morihei (the Founder of
      aikido), ‚Äúlove‚Äù. Budo literally means ‚Äúmartial way‚Äù. As aikido is a budo
      art, the techniques utilized derive from combat systems created by
      warriors in Japan‚Äôs feudal age. However, Morihei‚Äôs philosophy was to
      combine the techniques with the spirit of heaven and earth, thus creating
      a ‚ÄòWay‚Äô for training body and mind with unreserved love for all things.

      Capoeira is an African-Brazilian martial art that incorporates acrobatics,
      dance, music, and songs in a rhythmic dialogue of body, mind, and spirit.
      It is a communal game in which two opponents play each other inside the
      roda (a circle), formed by the other players who create rhythm for the
      game by clapping, singing and playing the berimbaus (African-Brazilian
      traditional instruments, considered the soul of Capoeira) and other key
      instruments. The two opponents compete with each other using capoeira
      movements, camouflaging the self defense kicks and moves with playful
      acrobatics and dance-like moves spontaneously creating strategy to fool
      their partner and catch them off guard.

      a completely original campaign was made to support it!¬†The current
      campaign is set in a distant fantasy world named Evanon where Heroes &
      villains fight for dominance and Monsters roam the land.¬†Do you and your
      friends have what it takes to save the land from the evil threatening it?¬†
      Or will you join the forces of darkness and bring about destruction and
      chaos? If you have a desire to act as a tough barbarian, a sneaky rogue, a
      wise wizard, or even a fun loving bard, now is the time to try it out and

        Sometimes the best way to grow in one activity is through training a
        different discipline. Yoga, climbing, and martial arts are three
        practices that enhance the others, intersecting in the development of
        body awareness, the cultivation of a steady mind, and the need for calm
        breathing. This class incorporates practices from yoga, Qigong, exercise
        science, and meditation. Poses will be offered with explanations and
        modifications for practitioners of all levels. Climbers and martial
        artists can expect to improve balance, gain core strength, and increase
        flexibility and range of motion through regular practice.

        Ashtanga is the bouldering of yoga: it is challenging, rigorous, and
        offers a lifetime of practice and growth. The emphasis is on linking
        movement with breath, following a regular sequence of poses so that
        practitioners can grow in fluency over time. By moving steadily through
        poses, the body generates heat that helps open and lengthen muscles.
        Through Ashtanga yoga, climbers can develop tremendous amounts of
        flexibility, core strength, and steadiness. By increasing awareness and
        flexibility in the body, we can enhance mental agility as well,
        ultimately fostering a steadier experience on the rock.
